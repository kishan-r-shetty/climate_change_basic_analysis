# climate_change_basic_analysis
An attempt at analyzing climate change using python.
# Climate Change Analysis

## Dataset Used
This project utilizes CO2 emission data from the following dataset:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/koustavghosh149/co2-emission-around-the-world

## Overview
This Python-based project analyzes climate change trends by examining CO2 emissions across different countries and regions from 1990 to 2019. The analysis includes trend detection, predictions, and regional comparisons.

## Features
- **Top CO2 Emitters Analysis**: Identifies the top 4 emitters in 2019.
- **Trend Analysis**: Uses polynomial regression to detect emission trends.
- **Prediction Analysis**: Predicts future emissions using historical trends and confidence intervals.
- **Regional Comparisons**: Analyzes emissions across different regions.
- **Historical Changes**: Examines changes in emissions over time, highlighting significant increases and decreases.

## Technology Stack
- **Python Libraries**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, scipy
- **Machine Learning**: Polynomial regression for trend and prediction analysis

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary dependencies:pandas,numpy,matplotlib,seaborn,scikit-learn,scipy
##
Polynomial regression and other basic techniques have been used for preliminary analysis, but a more statistically sophisticated approach would be required for greater accuracy.
